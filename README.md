cd trip-planner-ai
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) or pip environment ready:

```bash
poetry install
# or
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set up OpenAI API Keys

Export your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:

##  Agent Class Blueprint

All agents are initialized in the `TravelAgents` class:

```python
TravelAgents().expert_travel_agent()
TravelAgents().city_selection_expert()
TravelAgents().local_tour_guide()
```

You can call these individually or orchestrate them via a Crew workflow.
